# randomWalker
Implimenting a random Walker Interface, to draw with and implementing Vanilla Javascript Databinding

## Backlog
- screenShot of Canvas element
- limit Range/Type of Value through Databinding

## Ideas / Questions
- totally randomize movement within Range?
- Randomize length?
- Implement Vector Type for Canvas analogue to what Coding Train did?
- Probability to move to mouse Position?
- other Patterns? Like Writing ... you can select Writing, and then provide the word (max?) you want to be typed
- more generalized approach to DataBinding?
